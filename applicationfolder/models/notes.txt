No "CentralFridgeList" or manager because there is (as of yet)
not plan to include more than 1 main storage area.

CentralFoodList is for keeping a registry of ingredients
and so is CentralRecipeList and CentralCookBooklist.

Use of the word "Central" is simply future-proofing for possible
collections, differents kitchens etc. They could all be without 
"central".
