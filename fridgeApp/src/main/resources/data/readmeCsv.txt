The contents of these csv files have been partially populated by
ChatGPT after feeding it a self-made dataset of around 1/4 of the total current 
amount for reference.

I.e. foodlist.csv had 20 self-made ingredients, but the rest have been automatically generated.

The recipes use key=value for amounts.
