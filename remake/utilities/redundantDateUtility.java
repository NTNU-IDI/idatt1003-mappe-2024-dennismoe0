/**
 * !!!IGNORE
 * 
 * Remade DateUtility class. New version will use a simpler method to convert
 * from String to number.
 * This version will remove the hyphen between the year, month, and day.
 * "25-06-2024" will be "25062024".
 * This will make it easier to check without unecessary imports, but will still
 * require the correct format.
 * 
 * !!! IGNORE ABOVE !!!
 * 
 * VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
 * Might be unecessary considering I could just use the client to make the user
 * input date, month, then year (combine into long)
 * instead of even using a string. Output to String for display purposes.
 * 
 * Just concentate inputs in client, then add hyphens for display.
